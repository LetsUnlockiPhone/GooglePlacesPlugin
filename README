This is a plugin for a SiriProxy to use Google Places.

To install:

Add this to your config.yml inside of the .siriproxy foler:

    - name: 'GPP'
      git: 'git://github.com/robbederks/GooglePlacesPlugin.git'
	
These are the supported commands: 'nearby (*)', 'Where am I'. These commands are also translated into German. See the siriproxy-gpp.rb file inside the /lib folder for these commands.
